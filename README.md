# wxPython Chinese Typing Software  
類似台灣TQC中打計算標準的中打軟體，讀取文字檔當作題目並計時打字與算分數。  
Chinese typing software that it's standard close to TQC certification to be used in Taiwan, can load custom text files as article,          countdown, and calculate the score.  
## Why I want to build this project?  
以前我碰觸過TQC的打字標準或軟體，覺得這種使用文章來測試中打速度的軟體更貼近生活上使用中文打字的情境，前鎮子練習中打時也特別去網路上找有人流出帶有舊題庫的打字軟體。  
練習途中開始萌生了追求更開放且沒有版權問題的打字軟體的想法，後來也因此發現了[typing.tw](typing.tw)，並開始有了自己寫一套打字軟體的想法。  
A long time ago, I found the TQC typing software that uses articles to practice Chinese typing ability.  It seems like the best solution to improve Chinese typing skills in life.  
When I practice Chinese typing a few years ago, I tried to find TQC typing software that was not the latest version on the network, and begin to think about where to find software that open source and had no copyright. and then I found [typing.tw](typing.tw), and want to code one by myself.  
## Which functions I already done?  
* Basic UI
* Load article, Countdown, and Type
* Result screen layout
## Which functions I'm working now and may need some help?  
* Check article function(To check and calculate score)  
**Need to match rules at "TQC 規範.txt" in the repo(Refer to [TQC certificate Website](https://www.tqc.org.tw/TQCNet/CertificateDetail.aspx?CODE=r1y127Koepg=)):**
## Coding requirements  
* Python 3
* wxPython  
```pip install wxpython```
